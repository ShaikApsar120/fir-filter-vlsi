# FIR Filter - VLSI Design Project

This project demonstrates the **VLSI design of an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter** for DSP (Digital Signal Processing) applications. It includes both the **Verilog hardware description code** and **MATLAB simulation code** to verify filter functionality.

## 🔧 Project Files

- `fir_filter.v` – Verilog code for the FIR filter implementation.
- `fir_coefficients.m` – MATLAB script to generate filter coefficients.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- MATLAB (for filter design & coefficient generation)
- Xilinx / ModelSim / Vivado (to simulate the Verilog code)

## 📁 How it works

1. FIR filter coefficients are generated using MATLAB.
2. These coefficients are then applied in a Verilog-based FIR filter.
3. The design can be simulated and tested in any FPGA simulation environment.

## 📌 Applications

- Audio and video signal processing
- Digital communication systems
- Real-time embedded DSP applications
